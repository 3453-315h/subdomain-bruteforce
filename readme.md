subdomain bruteforce for windows is best used in conjunction with other tools - combining their results and dupekilling them.
it uses async get requests to brute force subdomains and is pretty fast and accurate over p80/443. 
i may add multi-host support, [recursion](https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion), web spidering, directory and
file enumeration in the future. as well as making it more traditionally user friendly. 
dirbuster for linux is handy but it only targets one host at a time and doesn't discover subdomains.<br/>
