subdomain bruteforce for windows is best used in conjunction with other tools - combining their results and dupekilling them.
it uses async get requests to brute force subdomains and is pretty fast and accurate over p80/443.

**roadmap, misc. notes**<br/>
i may add multi-host support, [recursion](https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion), web spidering, directory and
file enumeration in the future. as well as making it more traditionally user friendly.  re: file/directory scanning - 
[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is incredible. that's written in go and is fast and feature rich. probably use that instead.
